# Stock-Market-Predictor

A stock market predictor in Python that uses long short term memory for its judgements.

This stock market predictor will have the following features:

- [ ] Utilise financial data from Yahoo finance
- [ ] Use training and testing data to evaluate the results
- [ ] Hopefully work well

Time series modelling is nothing new within stocks as it looks at the price history and attempts to predict what the future prices will be. However as most people know, stocks are volatile and whilst some tactics such as reading current events and the news helps, a lot of stock movement is sometimes down to random chance.

The stock that is focussed on in this program is Apple Inc.(AAPL)
This was mainly chosen due to its main foothold as one of the most profitable companies in the world as well as it can be predicted easily due to there being a product announcement every year in September which usually raises the stock.

It should be noted that the COVID-19 Worldwide Pandemic has affected stocks in quite a large manner with most stocks tanking for a few weeks and then some raising to the highest that they've been with others at historical lows. Due to this I am using a dataset that ranges from the years 2008 until 2017, however I will soon upgrade this to include up to the end of 2020 once I find a suitable dataset.

The reason I've decided to start this project was due to a great fascination of mine within the financial markets. I've also been to business school, where I've gained expereince in the Bloomberg terminal and have various diplomas and certificates within finance which makes this a journey that I'd love to give a shot and pursue.

The program works by retrieving up to date data for a desired stock and analysing this data for any patterns through averaging. Prediction is only accurate for a few days
